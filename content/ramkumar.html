        <td>Although he may be small in stature, Ramkumar Venkateswaran is a big personality among the 13s- bigger than his name. His passions for rock and roll and ice hockey might surprise you, but surprise is his middle name (actually his middle name is twice as long so this is just more convenient). <br /> <br /> 

He also takes pride in his performance in the classroom as a course 6 premed student and his South Asian culture. With his big personality comes a big heart; in the summer he loves being a counselor for Camp Kesem. He absolutely enjoys being a brother of PBE</td>
