        <td>Chris Welch's social nature and personality make him more popular than the brand of juice he shares his name with. From his taste for indie hipster bands (most so unheard of it would put someone from Seattle to shame) and his wardrobe of plaid shirts, he is well on his way to living the Old Money Dream, putting his Course 2-OE skills to use and retiring on a yacht in the Caribbean. Hailing from LA, Chris has a large sense of pride for his hometown and is willing to fight anyone who says In 'N Out is as bad as it actually is. Chris enjoys working out and taking pictures with his Nikon D5000 which is almost as cool as Aron's Canon T1i.
