        <td>My name is Thiago Vieira, pronounced Tee-ah-go, no "th" sound please. Born in Brazil, but raised in Saline, Michigan since a kid, I frequently wonder why my family chose to leave the sunny weather of my homeland when I go back and visit every year. A sophomore at MIT, I am majoring in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering and Physics, while also doing economics research. When not making sure that the bills are getting paid as PBE's Treasurer, you might catch me swimming, playing frisbee or making my roommates cry as I get overkill's against them in Halo Reach.</td>
