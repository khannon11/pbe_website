        <td>Matthew Barron was born in the greatest sports city in the United States, Pittsburgh.  An avid Steelers fan, you will always find Matt watching the Steelers game with his terrible towel, being taunted by people who know nothing about football, and crying after harrowing losses.  Overall, just being a better fan than Nahum Seifeselassie.  Other than cheering for Pittsburgh sports, Matt enjoys wearing lax pinnies, reading Barney Stinson's blog, training to be the next Joey Chestnut, and watching videos of Sidney Crosby.  Matt has also spent the past decade training to be the perfect housewife by learning how to cook and bake.  Girls, you can offer him your cookie for a bite of one of his.</td>
