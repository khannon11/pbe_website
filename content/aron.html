        <td> Aron Dreyfoos is what makes the Pacific Northwest the Pacific Northbest. Hailing from his stomping grounds in Seattle, WA, Aron can easily tell you why your coffee is inferior to his, but you'll need more than just coffee to keep up with his lively nature. Sleeping all day and staying up all night (to p-set or to party), you'd swear he was a vampire. It's hard to tell with the lack of sunshine up there in the PNW, but to say the very least, he knows how to make it rain. That's the life of a mechanical engineer and a businessman, and if his life is too fast-paced for you, maybe you should take a picture! Aron makes sure he takes plenty. Gaining his inspiration from his black best friend, Chris, this culturally aware humanitarian totes his Canon T1i like a gunslinger, yet he doesn't need a weapon to be the ladykiller he is. Aron Dreyfoos is smooth like peanut butter in any sticky situation, sweet enough to be any girl's jam, but most importantly, he is the bread and butter of this fraternity.
