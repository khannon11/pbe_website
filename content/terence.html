        <td>Terence grew up in the local area, making him an expert at taking girls out to dazzling dates, secret lakes, and five-star lodging. Apart from his weekend getaways, Terence "Roids" Hsu consumes record-amounts of anabolic supplements, making up for lost training time in his earlier years when all he did was play piano and study for his SATs like a good Chinese son. HEN HAO. Terence has an avid interest in finance, directs special events at Sloan Business Club, is an Emerson Piano Scholar, and has dabbled in a cappella and various sororities.</td>
