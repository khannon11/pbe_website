        <td>Here's the skinny on Dhruv Parthasarthy. After graduating from India, Dhruv was accepted into MIT under Susan Hockfield's "Reduce the dining deficit" program. The administration figured that hiring thinner students like Dhruv would significantly reduce the dining costs of the campus at large and save MIT some much needed cash. Dhruv enjoys eating new foods (all American foods are new to him because he only ate rice before), and working out to bulk up. You can catch Dhruv around campus sneaking into study breaks by slipping through that slight crack between a door and the wall.

 <br><br>He is currently a double major in Mathematics with Computer Science and Economics. His main academic interests are development and using technology to find new solutions to existing problems in the developing world. In his free time, he likes to play basketball, tennis, and work out. He's a board member of the Undergraduate Economic Association and also a coordinator and counselor of Camp Kesem, a summer camp for children who's parents have cancer. He also volunteers as a mentor for middle school in Cambridge. Hit him up if you need a weight loss plan.
