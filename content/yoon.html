        <td>My name is Richard Yoon, but you can just call me Richard Poon. And that's because I get all the Poon. I was born in South Korea and immigrated to Michigan when I was 10. Just like every other Korean boy I started doing Tae-Kwon-Do (Korean national sport) at age 4 and I am a 3rd degree black belt and I have placed 1st place in many Michigan State Championship tournaments. Besides doing Tae-Kwon-Do I play varsity football at MIT. My max during my prime was 335lb Bench and 525lb Squat. (AKA just don't mess with me) I also enjoy doing many things ranging from street drumming, rapping, to painting. My rap name is Chocolate Twinkie, "Yellow out side but black in side", (you can urban dictionary it). From what I said so far, you are thinking this kid is a roid head, jock, douche bag, but actually I am not. I enjoy volunteering and doing whatever I can to be a positive influence to the community and I volunteer as a big brother for Big Brother of Boston, a mentor for Quest and Gates Scholar, and I am the co-president of Alternative Spring Break Club. I also serves as the vice-President of KSA, team leader for Ventureships, member for Sloan Business Club, and member of the Electrical Vehicle Team. All in all, I am a down to earth guy. I enjoy good conversation and like hanging out and helping. So come say hi, and if you need any help let me know, I am a good listener and I give pretty good advice (at least that's what the ladies say). But just a warning, don't get on my bad side like Zach did. Don't be a smart ass and you are fine.
